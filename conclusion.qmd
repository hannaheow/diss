In this dissertation, we have examined how migration and urbanicity shape health outcomes at the county-level across the United States. We have highlighted the importance of both structural (contextual) and individual (compositional) factors, showing that migration flows and urban characteristics jointly influence mental health, mortality, and place-based health disparities.

In the first manuscript, we focus on structural, or contextual, factors by examining the impact of urbanicity on mental health outcomes across the US. Analyzing self-reported poor mental health days, we find that urban counties, particularly large central metro areas, report fewer poor mental health days than their rural counterparts. We attribute this urban advantage to contextual health factors such as better access to exercise, mental health services, and healthier food environments, which collectively act as protective factors for mental health in urban areas. In contrast, rural counties experience higher rates of poor mental health days, a disparity that cannot be fully explained by the contextual factors we assessed. This finding suggests a need for further investigation into rural-specific stressors and underscores the importance of tailored public health policies that address both the structural benefits in urban settings and the distinct challenges faced by rural communities.

The second manuscript shifts focus to compositional factors, analyzing how migration affects county-level health outcomes by changing the demographic makeup of a place. Using IRS migration data and CDC mortality records, we find that migration flows enhance the predictive power of health models, indicating that compositional changes driven by migration significantly shape local health outcomes. In particular, the characteristics of both incoming and outgoing populations play a crucial role, suggesting that the health profiles of individuals migrating into or out of counties have direct implications for health disparities. These findings support the notion that migration’s impact on local health goes beyond individual mobility, highlighting the importance of compositional factors in public health planning. Consequently, we advocate for public health policies that consider the unique health needs of migrating populations, which could inform support and resources for counties undergoing significant demographic shifts.

In the third manuscript, we apply tensor decomposition to evaluate migration as a dynamic system, examining spatiotemporal patterns in health that correspond to each county's role within the broader migration network. This approach provides insights into how different migration trends—viewed as an interconnected system—shape health outcomes at the county level. We find that counties with significant out-migration, experience higher rates of premature mortality, suggesting that population loss may exacerbate local health challenges. In contrast, counties with stable migration flows appear to enjoy better health outcomes, indicating that stability in migration may positively influence community health. This study underscores the importance of understanding migration as a system that influences both contextual and compositional health factors.

This dissertation has several limitations. First, the use of county-level data introduces the potential for ecological fallacy, as conclusions drawn from aggregate data may not apply to individuals within each county. Additionally, the reliance on IRS migration flow data, which excludes non-tax-filers, informal migration, and international migration, may underrepresent lower-income populations and certain migration patterns, such as displacement or forced migration. Despite adjustments for various contextual and compositional factors, unmeasured confounding variables may remain, including those related to structural inequities (e.g., redlining, systemic racism) or individual characteristics (e.g., mental health predispositions). Furthermore, the observational nature of the study makes it difficult to determine whether migration and urbanicity directly influence health outcomes, or if health disparities drive migration patterns instead. We also do not account for different types and motivations of migration, such as voluntary versus forced, which may have distinct health impacts. Lastly, the definitions of urbanicity used may oversimplify the rural-urban continuum, potentially masking health variations within heterogeneous urban and suburban categories. These limitations highlight areas for cautious interpretation and suggest directions for future research.

Future research could explore several areas to build on these findings. First, examining how different migration types and motivations—such as economic moves versus environmental displacement—affect health outcomes in both origin and destination counties could clarify the unique health impacts of voluntary versus forced migration. Additionally, an obvious next step would be to compare the ACS and IRS migration datasets to assess how data source choice influences findings on migration and health. Further research could also investigate how structural inequities like redlining and systemic racism mediate the relationship between migration, urbanicity, and health outcomes. Finally, studying the effects of targeted health interventions in urban and rural environments could reveal how tailored approaches impact the health of migrating populations and receiving communities, particularly in underserved rural areas. These questions would help refine policies aimed at reducing health disparities across varied demographic and geographic contexts.

Our findings illustrate the importance of viewing migration as not just an individual choice but a systemic force influencing the health of entire communities. Effective public health strategies must address both structural advantages in urban areas and the unique health needs in rural settings while considering the demographic shifts and systemic impacts of migration. As migration patterns evolve and impact communities differently, our research provides a foundation for future studies and health policies that account for mobility, structural inequities, and the varied health landscapes across urban and rural United States. Through such localized, mobility-aware interventions, public health can more effectively tackle disparities and improve outcomes across diverse settings.
