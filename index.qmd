# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Throughout this dissertation, we explore the interconnected impacts of
migration and urbanicity on place-based health determinants across the
United States. Traditional place-based health measures often overlook
the dynamic influence of migration, while conventional migration studies
typically do not assess the broader place-level health impacts on origin
and destination locations. By examining contextual (structural) and
compositional (individual) factors, we assess how migration flows
influence local health outcomes across varying urban and rural
environments. Using publicly accessible county-level data and IRS
migration flow records, we highlight how urbanicity and migration
patterns together shape place-based health disparities, with special
emphasis on mental health, premature mortality, and socioeconomic
factors. Employing advanced spatial and tensor decomposition models, we
aim to provide insight into the dynamics of population health, offering
implications for localized health policy interventions and resource
allocation across diverse communities.

been greatly shaped by the work we do together. I feel so lucky to have
the opportunity to learn from you all.

The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) deserves a huge
shout-out as well. This research would not have been possible without

CHTC office hours.

I also want to recognize the University of Wisconsin Writing Center.
