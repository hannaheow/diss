Place-based measures of health can be simplified into "contextual" and "compositional" categories. **Contextual factors** refer to the structural characteristics of a place, such as greenspace, transportation options, and access to healthcare. In this dissertation, we consider contextual factors to be synonymous with structural factors since they represent the broader social, economic, and environmental structures that shape health outcomes. In contrast, **compositional factors** pertain to the characteristics of individuals within a place, including demographic attributes, behaviors, and health status [@macintyre2002a]. Though we may think of them separately, context and composition are mutually reinforcing [@cummins2007]. Contextual features (an isthmus, for example) shape the behaviors of a population (enjoyment of water and outdoor activities), and these behaviors then increase demand for additional contextual features (bike paths) which in turn affect the health of the total population residing in Madison. This interdependence highlights the complexity of addressing health disparities, as interventions must consider both the characteristics of the population and the structural conditions of the place. Moreover, both types of factors are inherently linked to population migration, as they both affect and are affected by the movement of people.

However, despite the growing importance of understanding how place affects health, place-based measures of health often overlook the dynamic nature of human populations. The movement of people shapes—and is shaped by—both contextual and compositional factors, meaning that static place-based assessments may miss key drivers of health outcomes. This gap is compounded by the fact that studies of the effects of migration tend to assess individual-level health outcomes rather than the effects of migration on place-based measures of health. As a result, there is a need to investigate how mobility influences health not just for individuals, but for the places they move into, out of, and between.

The overarching goal of this dissertation is to enhance our understanding of how mobility influences place-based health. This understanding will enable local decision-makers to consider mobility patterns when formulating policies to improve health outcomes for all individuals across different locations. Throughout this dissertation, we quantify and develop methods for assessing the relationship between population mobility and place-based health measures.

This dissertation is structured around three primary aims:

1.  **Contextual Factors and Urbanicity:** The first aim focuses exclusively on contextual place-based health factors to quantify potential mediating structural factors between urbanicity and mental health.

2.  **Compositional Factors and Migration:** The second aim centers on compositional place-based health factors by examining how county-to-county migration flows impact models of county-level health.

3.  **Integration of Contextual and Compositional Factors:** The third aim examines migration as both a contextual and a compositional place-based health factor, using spatio-temporal modeling to assess how the interaction between migration patterns and local geographic context influences premature mortality rates and may contribute to place-based health inequities.

## Defining contextual measures of health

**Place**, as it relates to health, is defined not just by geographic boundaries, but by the unique set of structural and environmental characteristics that influence the health of the populations residing within them. These **contextual health factors** encompass a wide range of elements, including socioeconomic conditions, physical environment, availability of healthcare services, and social infrastructure. Understanding these factors is essential for comprehending how different places can impact health outcomes and contribute to health disparities.

Numerous studies have outlined the effects of socioeconomic conditions on health, both at the individual and place-level. Areas with higher levels of poverty, unemployment, and lower educational attainment often exhibit poorer health outcomes due to limited access to resources and opportunities that promote healthy living [@diezroux2001]. Lack of economic opportunity can lead to food insecurity, inadequate housing, and reduced access to healthcare services, all of which have direct and indirect effects on the health of communities. Additionally, even after controlling for individual-level health factors, neighborhood disadvantage has been shown to be related to higher rates of mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular conditions [@diezroux2007; @pickett2001].

Environmental and climate-related factors also play a significant role in shaping health outcomes. Factors such as air and water quality, availability of green spaces, and exposure to pollutants can significantly influence the incidence of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and mental health disorders. For instance, communities located near industrial sites may suffer from higher levels of pollution, which can lead to adverse health effects over time. However, environmental resources and stressors are not distributed equally, with marginalized communities, particularly people of color, disproportionately bearing the brunt of negative impacts [@environm; @banzhaf2019].

The availability and accessibility of healthcare services are critical health factors. Areas with a higher concentration of healthcare professionals, facilities, and services generally experience better health outcomes, as residents can more easily access preventive care, receive timely diagnoses, and undergo necessary treatments, leading to higher overall healthcare utilization [@andersen2014; @léonard2009]. A study specifically examining maternal healthcare found that a one-unit increase in population density corresponds to a 0.2% increase in maternal healthcare coverage on average [@hanlon2012]. In contrast, rural regions and underserved urban areas often encounter substantial barriers to healthcare access, contributing to treatment delays and poorer health outcomes.

Social infrastructure, including the presence of community organizations, social networks, and public health initiatives, contributes to the health of a place, with evidence suggesting that both access and mix of social infrastructure are important to overall wellbeing [@davern2017]. Public libraries, for instance, can be used to promote public health by providing healthcare services, health information, and linkage to health-related services [@philbin2019], with some public libraries even training staff to administer naloxone [@feuerstein-simon2022] and assist patrons with the Affordable Care Act health insurance enrollment process[@collins2015]. Places with robust social infrastructure can buffer against adverse health outcomes and enhance overall community well-being.

The idea of place, as conceptualized by contextual health factors, encompasses a broad array of structural and environmental elements that collectively influence the health of populations. By examining socioeconomic conditions, physical environment, healthcare availability, and social infrastructure, researchers and policymakers can better understand and address the complex determinants of health at the community level.

## Defining compositional measures of health

**Place**, when considered through the lens of **compositional health factors**, is defined by the characteristics and attributes of the individuals who inhabit it. These factors include demographic variables, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and predispositions of the population. Understanding these compositional elements is crucial for identifying how individual-level factors aggregate to influence overall health outcomes in different geographical contexts.

Demographic variables such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity are fundamental compositional factors that shape the health profile of a place. For example, communities with a higher proportion of elderly individuals may experience greater prevalence of chronic, resource intensive diseases since 79% of individuals over age 70 have at least one chronic condition [@reducing]. Additionally, older female adults living alone may be reliant on public transportation options since they are least likely to live in households with access to at least one vehicle [@li2024].

Socioeconomic status (SES) is another critical and complex compositional factor that significantly influences health outcomes. It is widely accepted that higher SES is generally associated with better health outcomes due to greater access to healthcare resources, healthier living conditions, and greater educational and employment opportunities. One study of myocardial infarction patients in Minnesota found that a \$10,000 increase in income estimated from census tract data was associated with 10% reduction in risk of mortality [@gerber2008]. Similarly, individuals in the lowest household income quartile have self-reported rates of poor or fair health more than twice as high as individuals of the same age with incomes in the 25th through 50th percentile [@smith2004]. Additionally, there is strong correlation between high rates of income inequality and lower life expectancy across OECD countries[@kawachi1999; @commenta], and some research suggests a correlation between income inequality and high rates of obesity [@zaman2008]. <!--# need to distinguish between SES as contextual and SES as compositional -->

::: {style="color: red"}
Health behaviors, including diet, physical activity, and smoking, can be considered compositional factors that vary widely among populations and significantly impact health outcomes. Places where healthy behaviors are more prevalent typically exhibit lower rates of chronic diseases and higher overall life expectancy than places where unhealthy behaviors are more prevalent[@mokdad2004]. Smoking, a classic example, is causally related to cancer, meaning that communities with high rates of smoking will also have high rates of cancer [@lortet-tieulent2016]. Many behavioral factors are shaped by structural factors and inequities. For example, limited access to nutrient-rich foods in Black and low-income neighborhoods is a direct result of food apartheid—a system sustained by discriminatory policies and practices [@gripper2022]. These structural barriers, including the concentration of fast-food outlets and the scarcity of fresh produce, drive poor dietary behaviors, reinforcing health disparities in marginalized communities.
:::

The connection between health behaviors and structural inequities underscores the need to recognize that compositional factors, such as individual health behaviors, do not exist in isolation but are deeply influenced by the broader contextual environment. Many researchers consider compositional (individual) factors as outcomes of contextual (structural) influences [@crear-perry2020; @heller2024]. One study estimates that 40 percent of the relationship between neighborhood and health can be explained by contextual factors while 60 percent can be explained by compositional factors [@ross2008]. The exact breakdown between compositional and contextrual factors is highly complex, and interpretations can vary signifcantly depending on the methods and frameworks used. Socioeconomic status is often shaped by contextual factors such as the quality of local education systems, availability of job opportunities, and overall economic conditions; meanwhile health behaviors are influenced by the built environment, access to preventive healthcare, access to recreational facilities, and food options [@gordon-larsen2006; @sallis2018]. This interdependence highlights the complexity of addressing health disparities, as interventions must consider both the characteristics of the population and the structural conditions of the place.

In summary, defining place in terms of compositional health factors involves examining the aggregate characteristics of individuals within a geographic area. Demographic variables, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and predispositions collectively shape the health outcomes of a place. By analyzing these compositional factors in combination with contextual factors, researchers and policymakers can better understand the health needs of different communities and develop targeted interventions to address specific health disparities.

## Defining Urbanicity

Urbanicity—as defined by the population density and proximity to urban centers of a place— plays a critical role in influencing health and migration patterns. **Urbanicity is both a contextual and a compositional factor** since it is directly related to both the structural resources as well as the human-related resources within a place. Urban areas, with their dense populations, advanced infrastructure, and abundant resources, offer distinct health advantages and challenges compared to rural areas. They often provide better access to healthcare, social organizations, educational, and financial opportunities, which are associated with positive health outcomes. However, urban areas may also face challenges such as limited access to green spaces, concentrated marginalized populations, crowded living conditions, and air pollution, which are linked to negative health outcomes. Migration patterns are often shaped by urbanicity, as individuals move from rural to urban areas seeking employment, education, and healthcare. Consequently, the urban nature of a place shapes the lived experiences of its inhabitants, influencing health disparities and the overall well-being of the population. The complexity of urbanicity and its effects on health requires careful analysis to account for sociodemographic differences and unobserved confounding variables.

One theory describing the relationship between urbanicity and health is the **Urban Health Penalty Hypothesis**, which posits that urban environments can negatively impact health due to factors such as pollution, overcrowding, and high levels of stress [@kearns1988]. Urban areas often face challenges like higher crime rates, noise pollution, and exposure to environmental toxins, which can lead to adverse health outcomes, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and mental health disorders. For instance, one cross-sectional study using survey data from Germany found that individuals who reported high levels of noise annoyance had more than double the odds of experiencing poor mental health compared to their non-annoyed peers, even after adjusting for covariates [@hammersen2016]. Migration from rural to urban areas can exacerbate these issues by increasing population density and straining existing health infrastructure, leading to reduced access to healthcare and reduced quality of environmental factors.

In contrast, the **Urban Advantage Hypothesis** suggests that urban areas offer better health outcomes due to improved access to healthcare services, education, employment opportunities, and social amenities. For example, a study of child mortality across 18 countries, found that children who migrated from rural areas to urban areas experienced lower rates of child mortality after migrating than their peers who remained in rural places. However, this advantage diminished after adjusting for socioeconomic factors such as healthcare access and economic opportunities [@bocquier2011]. Similarly, a study on the distribution of skills, employment, and industries across cities found a direct relationship between city size, skill abundance, and employment specialization [@davis2020]. Yet, data from the Demographic and Health Surveys has shows that even when controlling for poverty, children in urban areas have better health outcomes on average than children in nonurban areas [@vlahov2005]. This suggests that the relationship between urbanicity and health is more complex than just healthcare access and economic opportunities. Migration plays an important role in shaping these patterns, as the movement of populations from rural to urban areas can directly influence the demographic and health profile of urban and non-urban areas, leading to evolving health inequities between urban and rural migrants and non-migrants.

The **Structual and Social Determinants of Health Frameworks** emphasize the role of structural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors in shaping health outcomes. Urban environments often present a mix of both positive and negative social determinants. On one hand, cities provide better educational and economic opportunities, which are linked to improved health outcomes. On the other hand, urban poverty, social isolation, and unequal access to resources can contribute to health disparities. Urbanicity is related to how individuals experience and perceive their own determinants of health; for instance, a cross-sectional survey across eight countries found that urban residents prioritized healthcare as the most important determinant of health, whereas non-urban residents placed more emphasis on social support [@abdalla2024]. These rural-urban differences necessitate methodological approaches that account for spatial and temporal changes, particularly as populations may shift rapidly in urban settings[@ompad2007]. Migration further complicates this dynamic by altering the socioeconomic composition of cities, introducing diverse populations with varying health needs and challenges, thereby reinforcing the connection between migration, social determinants of health, and urbanicity.

Urbanicity is a contested and multifaceted concept, playing a pivotal role in shaping both health outcomes and migration patterns. As both a contextual (structural) and compositional factor, urbanicity influences access to healthcare, social resources, and environmental conditions, creating a complex landscape of health advantages and disadvantages. The Urban Health Penalty and Urban Advantage hypotheses underscore the dual nature of urban environments, which offer both opportunities and challenges for health. However, these relationships are far from straightforward, as they are shaped by a range of sociodemographic, environmental, and migration-related factors. Urbanicity interacts with broader structural determinants of health, highlighting the importance of considering how place and population dynamics evolve over time. Understanding urbanicity's effects on health requires a nuanced approach that accounts for both individual factors and the structural conditions of a place, as well as the ongoing impact of population mobility. This dissertation seeks to address these complexities, examining how urbanicity and migration together influence place-based health outcomes in diverse and dynamic contexts.

## Defining Migration

**Migration serves as both a cause and an effect of place**. As a cause, migration can reshape the demographic and socioeconomic composition of a place by introducing new populations with distinct attributes and needs, thereby influencing local resources, services, and social structures. For instance, an influx of migrants can stimulate economic growth, diversify cultural landscapes, and alter housing demands, thereby transforming the contextual characteristics of the destination. Conversely, migration is also an effect of place, driven by the push and pull factors inherent in the geographical, economic, and social environments of both origin and destination locations. Factors such as job opportunities, living conditions, environmental quality, and social networks can either attract or repel individuals from certain places, making migration a response to the existing contextual and compositional features of a location. Thus, understanding migration requires a dual perspective that acknowledges how places shape and are shaped by the movement of people.

Throughout this dissertation, we refer to migration as the movement of people between US counties. We do not attempt to measure or quantify international migration, nor are we able to account for forced migration, displacement, or other forms of involuntary migration. To capture internal migration, we rely on Internal Revenue Service migration flow data, which tracks household moves based on changes in tax return filings. This dataset provides valuable insights into population mobility by identifying when households have moved from one county to another within the United States. However, it is important to note that IRS data only captures formal, voluntary migration of tax-filing households and does not account for international migration or other informal forms of movement. While this dataset offers a robust measure of internal migration patterns, it is limited in that it excludes certain populations, such as those who do not file taxes or those involved in forced migration or displacement, which are important components of overall migration trends. <!--# need some citations using IRS data here or in the next para -->

Despite its limitations, IRS migration flow data offers a unique lens through which we can observe patterns of internal migration and how these movements reshape the demographic and social landscapes of communities. Since the data primarily captures the most routine, voluntary household moves of tax-filing individuals, it reflects a relatively stable and formal type of migration. If we find that migration is significant in shaping health outcomes using this data, it is likely that migration’s true impact is even more profound in real life, where more dynamic forms of movement—including informal, forced, and non-tax-filing migrations—also play a role. By examining where and when people move, we can begin to assess the broader implications of migration on health outcomes within places. Theories of migration provide valuable frameworks for understanding how migration influences the health of individuals and communities within places. These theories, when applied to internal migration, offer insights into both the contextual and compositional measures of health in a place.

Economic theories of internal migration focus on wage and employment opportunities as primary drivers of migration. According to macroeconomic models, individuals move from regions with surplus labor and low wages to areas with labor shortages and high wages, and in some cases, individuals move because they have particular skills that are more highly rewarded in specific regions [@borjas1992]. However, migration can also reinforce poverty, as poverty itself is a signficiant indicator of where people choose to move. In a study of the spatial concentration of poverty, poor individuals were found to be more likely to move into high-poverty areas where low-wage jobs and affordable housing were available while non-poor individuals were more likely to move out of these areas, further concentration poverty [@nord1998]. This movement can impact the health of both the sending and the receiving places since concentrated poverty is associated with worse health, overall [@auchincloss2002]. In sending areas, the outmigration of working-age individuals can lead to a shortage of healthcare providers and caregivers (a compositional factor of place), adversely affecting community health. Conversely, receiving areas may experience increased demand for healthcare and social services, which can strain existing resources but also lead to improvements in infrastructure due to increased funding and investment (compositional change resulting in contextual change) [@vasile2023]. <!--# excluding remittances, dual labor market theory, and world systems theory -->

Network theory explains how social connections facilitate migration by reducing costs and risks associated with moving​​. Previous patterns of migration can be used to predict future patterns of migration [@lorincz2019], suggesting that individual-level migration has implications for group-level migration. Additionally, in one study of internal migration in Austria, over 60% of migration flows were reciprocated, meaning that there was effectively an exchange of individuals from one region to another [@pitoski2021]. Similarly, return migration can lead to a "propogation effect" in which behaviors and health conditions from a destination of migration can change behaviors and health conditions in an origin of migration [@ginsburg2016]. Therefore, migrant networks can play a crucial role in health outcomes of migrants in both destination and origin places. Migrant networks can provide social support and information about healthcare services in destination areas and enhance migrants' access to healthcare by connecting them with resources and community support. However, reliance on informal networks can also lead to disparities in healthcare access and quality, particularly if migrants are excluded from formal healthcare systems due to legal or socioeconomic barriers​ [@vasile2023].

According to Lee’s theory of migration, migration is selective, meaning that individuals who migrate are not a random sample of the population from their origin [@lee1966]. Migration happens in response to "push" or "pull" factors—migrants are either “pushed” to leave an origin due to hardships or “pulled” to a destination by perceived opportunities. Positive selection is more commonly associated with pull factors, where migrants who are drawn to a destination for its benefits tend to have higher income or education levels. That said, in some cases, poor migrants are pulled to lower resource areas due to perceived lower cost of living [@fitchen1995]. Conversely, push factors often involve migrants who are driven out of their origin by adverse conditions, such as job loss or climate disasters, and may represent a negatively selected group. In some cases, entire populations are forced to migrate due to larger events like war or famine. Migration tends to be bimodal, with both the most advantaged and the least advantaged individuals choosing to relocate. This pattern may extend to the health status of migrants, where both the healthiest and least healthy individuals are more likely to move.

The displacement and concentration hypotheses discussed by Elliott and Pais [@elliott2010]align with Lee's framework of migration as a selective process driven by push and pull factors. The **displacement hypothesis** suggests that in more urban areas, socially vulnerable populations are disproportionately pushed out when a natural disaster occurs. This displacement occurs because these populations often lack the resources or social capital to recover in place, especially as wealthier residents leverage recovery dollars to rebuild and redevelop. This dynamic can be seen as a case of negative selection, where the most disadvantaged are pushed out of damaged regions due to the intersection of environmental hardship and personal financial strain.

On the other hand, the **concentration hypothesis** posits that in rural areas, socially vulnerable populations are more likely to remain or even increase in number when a natural disaster occurs. Here, push factors may still be at play, but the ability or willingness of wealthier residents to leave, coupled with falling property values, leads to the concentration of disadvantaged groups in these areas. This scenario could reflect the opposite end of Lee’s migration selectivity, where those who are least able to move—due to financial constraints or lack of alternative options—end up staying in or moving into the most impacted regions, further reinforcing local disadvantages​. This pattern mirrors trends seen in rural gentrification where the arrival of affluent newcomers pushes low-income rural residents to marginalized areas, intensifying economic and social inequality [@golding2014]. In both cases, the persistence or influx of vulnerable populations amplifies place-based disparities and strains local resources.

Research has shown that migrants moving from resource-depleted regions to areas with more resources tend to have better health than the average population at their destination, while those migrating from resource-rich areas to more depleted regions often have worse health compared to the local population at their new location [@norman2005]. Additionally, when barriers to migration are high, migrants are often healthier than the destination population, either because they have been selected through the migration process or because unhealthy individuals are less likely to migrate under difficult circumstances [@halliday2008]. Without knowing the individual circumstances or motivations behind migration, it is difficult to determine whether changes in health are driven by push or pull factors. Disentangling the relationship between health changes and migration patterns is one of the challenges when analyzing county-level data. <!--# removed cumulative causation theory and migration systems theory  -->

These theories of migration provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between migration, urbanicity, and health. Migration driven by economic, social, and structural factors can influence health outcomes through changes in healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and social support systems in both sending and receiving regions.

## Our Framework

[![Figure 1: Our Framework](images/framework.png)](Figure 1)

The framework we use to think about the relationships between migration, urbanicity, and contextual and compositional measures of the health of a place is shown in Figure 1. The left circle represents contextual factors, specifically the structural determinants of health, such as access to education, infrastructure, and environmental conditions. The right circle represents compositional factors, focusing on demographic characteristics, like age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We have made the contextual circle larger to reflect our value choice that contextual factors are more important to explaining the health of a place than compositional factors. CITE.

Urbanicity impacts both spheres. It affects context by shaping the built environment, access to resources, and exposure to environmental stressors. Simultaneously, it influences composition through population density, migration patterns, and social networks, which vary between urban and rural areas. Migration, driven by both push and pull factors, modifies the effect of urbanicity on contextual and compositional factors, often reshaping the health outcomes of individuals and communities within places. Thus, urbanicity links the structural and individual determinants of health, demonstrating how place-based and population-specific characteristics jointly influence health disparities. This framework emphasizes the intertwined nature of urbanicity, migration, and health outcomes, illustrating how contextual (structural) and compositional (demographic) factors both contribute to place-based health disparities.

## Policy Implications

Urbanicity, migration, and environmental stressors each pose unique public health challenges that require targeted policy strategies. Addressing both structural (contextual) and compositional aspects of place is essential, as they are inherently intertwined. Policies designed to reduce health disparities must simultaneously address the broader environmental factors that shape communities and the specific health needs of their populations.

County-level data, which we use for ecological analyses, is valuable for understanding how place relates to health outcomes. While individual-level differences cannot be captured, county-level analyses are useful for informing local policies aimed at improving the overall health of a population and reducing disparities within a county - thus, county-level analyses are useful in addressing both of the primary goals of population health: increasing the health of the population overall and reducing health disparities [@kindig2003]. As seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, local public health decisions, made by departments, school boards, and organizations, can significantly influence population health. County-level data also allow us to better represent rural areas, which often have smaller populations but face unique health challenges. While group-level data has limitations [@greenland1989], studying counties enables us to highlight the structural health factors that persist across populations.

Migration, particularly along the rural-urban continuum, can contribute to inequality in multiple ways. Studies have shown that rural-urban migration often widens existing economic disparities, as urban areas tend to have better access to resources and services compared to rural regions. For instance, a global analysis of migration patterns across 65 countries found that urban-rural divides account for about 40% of within-country inequality, with nations experiencing greater rural-urban gaps also seeing higher overall inequality [@young2013]. Furthermore, the rapid growth of urban populations has been linked to widening rural-urban disparities in health outcomes, such as increased child mortality rates in rural areas [@beatriz2018]. A county-level analysis of migration destinations for Hispanic populations found that rural counties with rapid Hispanic population growth since 1990 have the lowest rates of health insurance while metropolitan experiencing growth during the 2000s have insurance rates simlar to those of counties with established Hispanic populations [@monnat2016].

Migration can also influence social inequalities, with patterns differing by age group. Younger migrants, particularly those under 40, tend to reduce racial segregation in urban areas, while older migrants, especially those over 60, often contribute to increased segregation [@winkler2016]. Additionally, regions with a high proportion of recent migrants may experience environmental inequality, such as lower levels of green vegetation in urban areas, further exacerbating health and quality-of-life disparities [@fong2020]. This evidence highlights how migration patterns, especially between rural and urban areas, are intricately connected to both economic and social inequality.

As climate change exacerbates environmental stressors, such as pollution and extreme weather, policies must prepare communities for climate-induced migration. A study of internal migration in China found that individuals who were less educated and living in rural areas were more likely to migrate due to climate-related changes [@gray2020]. And among individuals who migrate from rural to urban areas are especially exposed to health risks such as water insecurity and infectious disease [@mazhin2020]. Likewise, migrants who are displaced due to climate change are especially likely to experience poor mental health [@anillw]. A recent study highlights that climate-induced migration could result in up to 300% increase in population density, amplifying urbanization pressures and increasing health risks in already stressed environments [@hsiang2016]. Similarly, expanding urban housing development in hazard-prone areas of the US increases the vulnerability of growing populations to extreme weather events, further amplifying the risks of disaster and health-related consequences for both long-term residents and incoming migrants [@strader2015]. Notably, recent findings show that urban densification drives increased exposure to earthquakes and hurricanes while suburban and rural expansion contributes to heightened flood, fire, and tornado risk [@iglesias2021], underscoring the need for effective urban planning and disaster preparedness policies to mitigate these compounded risks.

Understanding the health effects of migration and urbanicity through both contextual and compositional lenses is crucial. As climate change drives population movement, addressing these issues through informed public health interventions can reduce health inequities and lessen the potential negative impacts of climate-induced migration. Robust, adaptive health systems that are both climate-resilient and migrant-inclusive will play a key role in safeguarding public health in the face of these growing challenges.

## Specific Aims

The first chapter of this dissertation examines the influence of urbanicity on mental health in US counties, aiming to quantify contemporary relationships between the built environment and self-reported poor mental health days. The second chapter shifts the focus to migration, investigating how county-to-county migration flows influence average health metrics and the potential misattribution of health outcome changes when migration is not considered in models. The third chapter builds on these themes by exploring the interactions between migration patterns and premature age-adjusted mortality rates, using tensor decomposition techniques to uncover how spatial and temporal migration flows may contribute to health disparities across US counties.

**Chapter 1: Urbanicity and Mental Health in US Counties**

Geography may influence mental health by inducing changes in social, physical, and health-related environmental factors. This chapter seeks to quantify contemporary relationships between urbanicity and self-reported poor mental health days across US counties, incorporating both contextual and compositional measures. Using data from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, regression analyses were performed on 3,142 US counties, controlling for contextual variables such as state, income, and education, as well as compositional factors like age and race/ethnicity. Findings indicate that large central metro counties report fewer average poor mental health days compared to small metro counties, with differences partially mediated by contextual factors such as the built environment, including better food environments. Conversely, counties in the most rural category report more poor mental health days, with these disparities not mediated by considered factors. These results highlight the need for tailored public health strategies that address specific urban and rural mental health challenges, taking into account both the structural environment and the composition of the population.

**Chapter 2: Migration and Health Outcomes in US Counties**

This chapter investigates the impact of migration on county-level health outcomes in the United States, emphasizing the importance of considering compositional changes due to migration when analyzing health metrics alongside contextual county characteristics. Using mortality data from CDC WONDER and migration flow data from the IRS, the study develops novel extensions of autoregressive spatial error models to incorporate migration flows. The analysis focuses on premature age-adjusted mortality rates from 2011 to 2019, examining the influence of migration and urbanicity. The findings reveal that migration significantly improves the explainability of models for county-level health outcomes, showing that compositional changes in population due to migration, alongside contextual factors such as local healthcare infrastructure, are critical for understanding health disparities. By accounting for migration flows and health-related selection of migrants, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationship between migration and health outcomes, informing more precise public health policies.

**Chapter 3: Spatio-temporal analysis of county-to-county migration patterns on premature mortality**

This study focuses on the relationship between county-level migration patterns and health outcomes, specifically premature age-adjusted mortality rates, using IRS migration data from 2011 to 2019. The study applies tensor decomposition, a mathematical technique that models migration flows across space and time, to better understand how migration patterns shape health outcomes at the county-level. By analyzing how migration influences both the contextual (structural) and compositional (individual) factors of health, the study reveals that different migration patterns are associated with varying health outcomes. For instance, counties experiencing significant outmigration—particularly in the Southern United States—tend to face higher mortality rates, suggesting that outmigration may exacerbate health challenges in these regions. In contrast, counties involved in more stable migration flows, particularly in the Western and Southeastern U.S., seem to experience better health outcomes. The findings emphasize the importance of considering both the origin and destination of migration flows in order to fully understand how migration influences population health.
