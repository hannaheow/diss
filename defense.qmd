## Aims:

::: incremental
1.  Quantify the associations between place and self-reported mental health at the county level
2.  Explore how county-level migration can enhance our capacity to understand and explain county-level health
3.  Identify how a county's position within a migration system may be related to county-level health

## Motivation:

### Ha Makoae, Lesotho

![January 28, 2018](images/hamakoae.JPG){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
In Lesotho, 43 percent of households report that at least one family member lives away - according to the DHS 2014 survey [@botea]

Anecdotally:

-   host sister: boarding school in nation's capital; host father: diamond mine in SA

-   school principal: commutes to ha makoae during the week and home to family in district capital on weekend; son: boarding school in SA

-   students: families live in further remote areas than Ha Makoae so they live on their own in Ha Makoae in order to attend secondary school

## Motivation:

### Structural Determinants of Health

## Motivation:

### Urban-rural divide

![](images/ap_ruralurb_voting.png){fig-align="center"}

## Motivation:

### Looking forward

::: incremental
-   **Inequality**

    -   Rural-urban divides account for approximately 40% of within country inequality [@young2013]

    -   Growth of urban populations is associated with greater rural-urban gaps in health outcomes [@beatriz2018]

-   **Climate change**

    -   Climate-induced migration could result in up to 300% increase in population density [@hsiang2016]

    -   Urbanicity-related inequalities are related to climate susceptibility [@fong2020]
:::

## Goals:

::: incremental
-   Place-based determinants of health are often static and do not account for migration / movement of people

-   Assessments of the impact of migration on health often examine individual-level effects
:::

## Aim 1: Hypotheses

*Quantify the associations between place and self-reported mental health at the county level*

::: incremental
-   **Hypothesis 1A:** County-level averages in poor mental health days are related to urbanicity after accounting for county-level demographic differences

-   **Hypothesis 1B:** This relationship can be explained by differences in factors linked to the built environment (e.g. access to exercise, mental health providers, air pollution, violent crime, and severe housing problems)
:::

## *Note:*

Aim 1 findings have been [published in the Community Mental Health Journal](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-01082-x).

## Aim 1: Data

All data come from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps 2021 dataset

::: incremental
-   **Outcome:** self-reported poor mental health days from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

-   **Exposure:** urbanicity, as defined by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

-   **Controls:** sociodemographic makeup of each county
:::

## Aim 1: Data

All data come from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps 2021 dataset

![](aim1_images/table1.png)

## Aim 1: Approach

![](images/aim1_dag.png)

## Aim 1: Hypothesis 1A Approach

*County-level averages in poor mental health days are related to urbanicity after accounting for county-level demographic differences*

::: incremental
-   Calculate propensity scores

    -   We used logistic regression to calculate the propensity of belonging to a given urbanicity category conditional on confounding variables (education, income, percent Black, percent Hispanic, age) relative to reference category (small metro)

-   Calculate relative change in poor mental health days

    -   We used a mixed effects linear regression model with random effect for state (with inverse probability weights)
:::

## Aim 1: Hypothesis 1B Approach

*The relationship between urbanicity and mental health can be explained by differences in factors linked to the built environment*

We investigated 8 potential mediating factors:

![](aim1_images/table6.png)

## Aim 1: Hypothesis 1B Approach

*The relationship between urbanicity and mental health can be explained by differences in factors linked to the built environment*

Mediation analysis in two steps [@imai2010; @vanderweele2014]

::: incremental
-   Mentally unhealthy days \~ mediator + urbanicity

-   Mediator \~ urbanicity

-   Estimate of mediation: effect of urbanicity on mediator \* effect of mediator on mentally unhealthy days
:::

## Aim 1: Results

::: incremental
-   Controlling for state, age, income, education, and race/ethnicity, large central metro counties reported 0.24 fewer average poor mental health days than small metro counties (*t* = -5.78, *df* = 423, *p* \< 0.001)

-   Noncore counties had 0.07 more average poor mental health days than small metro counties (*t* = 3.06, *df* = 1690, *p* = 0.002)

-   Better mental health in large central metro counties was partially mediated by differences in the built environment, such as better food environments. Poorer mental health in noncore counties was not mediated by considered mediators.
:::

## Aim 1: Pitfalls and Alternatives

::: incremental
-   BRFSS data is modeled at the state level

-   We are using race and ethnicity as proxies for lived experiences that may differ by identity due to systemic injustices

-   Model dependent

-   Our findings are statistically significant but not clinically or biologically significant

-   County-level analyses may not adequately capture neighborhood nuances

-   Ecological analyses - which matters more: geography or population?
:::

## Aim 2: Hypotheses

Explore how county-level migration can enhance our capacity to understand and explain county-level health

::: incremental
-   **Hypothesis 2A:** County-to-county migration patterns improve the explainability of autoregressive models of county-level health outcomes

-   **Hypothesis 2B:** The role that county-to-county migration flows plays in county-level health outcomes differs signficantly between rural and urban counties

-   **Hypothesis 2C:** Taking into account unmeasured factors in county-to-county migration flows improves our ability to explain county-level health outcomes as well as the differential role that migration plays in urban versus rural counties
:::

## Aim 2: Variables

**Outcome:** $y_{it}$

County-level age-adjusted premature mortality rate per 100,000 population of county $i$ at time $t$

::: incremental
-   Premature mortality: any death occurring before age 75

-   Each $t$ is a single year from 2012-2019

-   Source: CDC WONDER Underlying Cause of Death
:::

::: notes
IMPUTATION using MICE modeling each var as a function of the others iteratively to improve imputations

MICE = multiple imputation by chained equations

used a custom binary predictor matrix including all vars: agerate, deaths, population

we imputed because we needed balanced panel data and because we did not want to systematically exclude rural counties

removed alaska and hawaii since our queen contiguity did not account for non contiguous

total of 3107 counties included in our data
:::

## Aim 2: Variables

**Baseline explanatory factor:** $y_{i,t-1}$

Lagged county-level age-adjusted premature mortality rate of county $i$ at time $t-1$ (i.e. the prior year)

## Aim 2: Variables

**Primary explanatory factor:** $mig_{it}$

Weighted average accounting for compositional change in a destination county $i$ at time $t$

$$ mig_{it} = \frac{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} y_{j,t-1} + y_{i,t-1} (pop_{i, t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})}{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} + (pop_{i,t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})} $$

::: incremental
-   $out_{jit}$ represents the number of movers from county $j$ to a destination county $i$ between year $t-1$ and year $t$

    -   Source: IRS migration data: number of personal exemptions claimed

-   $y_{j, t-1}$ is the lagged premature age-adjusted mortality rate of origin county $j$

-   $pop_{i,t-1}$ is the population under age 75 of county $i$ in the prior year $t-1$

    -   Source: CDC WONDER Underlying Cause of Death
:::

::: notes
Remember to note here that IRS data only captures internal migration; when I say "migrant" what I really mean is "mover"

CDC WONDER population counts come from the US Census Bureau "postcensal estimates" of the july 1 resident population;

census estimates capture 94-95% of the total US residents while irs data captures only \~45%
:::

## Aim 2: Variables

**Secondary explanatory factor:** $U_i$

Urbanicity as defined by the NCHS (same as Aim 1), grouped into urban and rural for each county $i$

1948 rural counties

1159 urban counties

## Aim 2: Variables

**Exploratory explanatory factor:** $amig_{it}$

Adjusted weighted average migration term for county $i$ in year $t$

$d_{ij}$ accounts for health-related selection of movers to county $i$ from county $j$

$$  amig_{it} = \frac{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} ( y_{j,t-1} + d_{ij}) + y_{i,t-1} (pop_{i, t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})}{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} + (pop_{i,t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})}$$

::: incremental
-   When $d_{ij} > 0$ county $i$ tends to attract less healthy movers

-   When $d_{ij} < 0$ county $i$ tends to attract healthier movers
:::

::: notes
dij = kij - li

where kij is specific to origin linked to destination and li is specific to destination only (since we have the flows only one way rn)

therefore dij represents the difference between the "push" of the origin and the "pull" of the destination ; dij is positive if the destination is "healthier" ie the destination is subtracted a greater value than the origin

and dij is negative when the destination is "less healthy" than the origin (ie the destination is subtracted a smaller value than the origin)
:::

## Aim 2: Models

Baseline Model:

$$  y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1t} + \beta_{2}y_{t-1,i} + \mu_{i} + \epsilon_{it}    $$

::: incremental
-   where $\beta_0$ is the intercept

-   $\beta_{1t}$ is a coefficient for the effect of each year $t$

-   $\beta_2$ is a coefficient to capture the effect of lagged premature age-adjusted mortality

-   $\mu_i$ is a random intercept for each county $i$

-   and $\epsilon_{it}$ represents spatial error as defined on the next slide....
:::

## Aim 2: Models

Baseline Model: **Spatial error**

$$ \epsilon_{it} = \lambda W \epsilon_{it} + u_{it}   $$

::: incremental
-   $\lambda$ is a scalar to represent the magnitude of spatial error

-   $W$ is a spatial weights matrix created using the "queen" criterion which considers counties that share any point as neighbors

-   $\mu_{it}$ is a random error term for each county and each year
:::

## Aim 2: Models

Iterative process:

::: incremental
1.  Test splines for $y_{i,t-1}$
2.  Test $mig_{it}$ with and without splines (***Hypothesis 2A***)
3.  Test interaction between $mig_{it}$ and urbanicity (***Hypothesis 2B***)
4.  Replace $mig_{it}$ with $amig_{it}$ and test values of $d_{ij}$ incrementing by 50 from -200 to 200 in units of premature deaths per 100,000 population (***Hypothesis 2C***)
:::

::: notes
dij = d(destination, origin)
:::

## Aim 2: Models

Iterative process:

5.  Test values of $d_{ij}$ dependent upon the urbanicity category of origin county $j$ and destination county $i$ such that $d_{ij}$ could be one of four values:

    ::: incremental
    -   $d_{uu}$ urban to urban
    -   $d_{rr}$ rural to rural
    -   $d_{ru}$ rural to urban
    -   $d_{ur}$ urban to rural
    -   Where each of $(d_{uu}, d_{rr}, d_{ru}, d_{ur})$ were varied factorially
        -   Coarse search: incrementing by 50 from -200 to 200
        -   Then incrementing by 20 around a minimum found in the coarse search
        -   We tested a total of 13,122 $(= 9^4 * 2)$ combinations of $(d_{uu}, d_{rr}, d_{ru}, d_{ur})$
    :::

## Aim 2: Results

**Hypothesis 2A:** Does the migration term add explainability to the baseline model?

YES - models including the $mig_{it}$ term had lower BIC scores than models without.

## Aim 2: Results

**Hypothesis 2B:** Does the role of $mig_{it}$ differ between rural and urban counties?

YES - $mig_{it}$ significantly enhances model explainability when accounting for urbanicity

## Aim 2: Results

![](images/aim2_BICplot.png)

## Aim 2: Results

**Hypothesis 2C:** Can we account for unmeasured factors related to health and migration?

Health-related selection may not be important to modeling county-level health. BIC score is minimized when $d_{ij} = 0$.

![](images/aim2_BIC_nourb.png)

## Aim 2: Results

**Hypothesis 2C:** Can we account for unmeasured factors related to health and migration when accounting for urbanicity?

Health-related selection may be important to modeling county-level health when we account for urbanicity. BIC score is minimized when $(d_{uu} = -100, d_{rr} = 0, d_{ru} = 0, d_{ur} = 20)$.

![](images/aim2_bic_withurb.png)

::: notes
For migration to rural counties (orange and red lines), min BIC score occurs when the model assumes these counties attract movers with average county health (ie when d = 0)

For urban-to-urban migration, lower BIC occurs when the model assumes the urban counties attract movers from counties with lower (BETTER) mortality rates, suggesting that movers tend to migrate from healthier urban counties to less healthy urban counties. OR that movers are healthier on average than their destination counties.

For rural to urban migration, urban destinations have slightly better LOWER premature mortality rates than their rural origins since min occurs at dur = 20 ; this possibly suggests that people move from rural areas to urban areas seeking better health. this matches the "pull" idea of urban counties. However the relationship between due and BIC is relatively flat, with all BIC scores close to the min -\> limited evidence of health-related selection from rural origins to urban destinations

REMEMBER: dur = d urban dest, rural origin

REMEMBER dij \> 0 -\> destination attracts less healthy movers; dij \<0-\> destination attracts healthier movers
:::

## Aim 2: Conclusion

::: incremental
-   Migration does matter!

-   Urbanicity matters even after accounting for migration

-   Some evidence that healthier urban destinations are connected to less healthy urban origins
:::

::: notes
migration patterns could lead to place-based health disparities in the long term
:::

## Aim 2: Pitfalls and Alternatives

::: incremental
-   Regression to the mean

-   Premature age-adjusted mortality rates serve as a proxy for overall county-level health

-   IRS data

-   Internal migration only

-   Pre-covid
:::

::: notes
-   IRS data includes only approximately 45% of the total US population

-   Known issues with the post 2011 data ; IRS took over data curation from census bureau in 2011 which meant that more tax returns could be included

-   sharp decline until 2014; sharp increase until 2016; volatility after 2016

-   sig statistical differences in county-to-county migration prob after 2011 compared to earlier periods
:::

## Aim 3: Hypothesis

Is a county's position within a migration system predictive of county-level health?

## Aim 3: Approach

**Tensor decomposition**

![Figure by Fan Guo http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJWET.2012.050958](images/cpdecomp.jpg)

::: notes
lots of ways to visualize this

commonly used for image processing

still quite new!!!!

recipe metaphor !!!!
:::

## Aim 3: Approach

**Constructing the tensor** $X$

A CUBE!

Origin by destination by time: $3109$ x $3109$ x $8$

Each entry in the tensor represents the $log(1+n)$ transformed number of movers from origin $i$ to destination $j$ in time period $k$.

## Aim 3: Approach

**Tensor Decomposition**

Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) represented as:

$$ X \approx \sum_{r=1}^R o_{ir} \cdot d_{jr} \cdot t_{kr}, \quad \text{such that } o_{ir} \geq 0, \, d_{jr} \geq 0, \, t_{kr} \geq 0 \, \forall \, i, j, k, r. $$

Where each $rth$ component corresponds to a unique "migration system", and the loadings $(o_{ir}, d_{jr}, t_{kr})$ represent the significance of each origin county $i$, destination county $j$, and year $k$ to each migration system $r$.

## Aim 3: Approach

**Spatial modeling**

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{r=1}^{R} \beta_{o_r} o_{ir} + \sum_{r=1}^{R} \beta_{d_r} d_{jr} + \sum_{r=1}^{R} \beta_{t_r} t_{kr} + \sum_{n=2}^{6} \gamma_n \text{Urbanicity}_n + \mu_{it} $$

::: incremental
-   Predictor variables: $o_{ir}, d_{jr}, t_{kr}$

    -   Loadings from the tensor decomposition corresponding to origin, destination, and time

-   Outcome variable: $y_{it}$

    -   Premature age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 population

-   Covariate: $Urbanicity_n$

    -   Six categories (same as Aim 1): large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, small metro, micropolitan, noncore

-   Spatial error: $u_{it}$

    -   Accounts for spatial correlation using Queen's contiguity
:::

::: notes
the only piece of model "selection" we are doing is to choose the value of R! which we do using the elbow plot. otherwise this is an exploratory model
:::

## Aim 3: Results

**Component Selection**

![](images/aim3_elbow.png)

::: notes
We tested 100 random seeds for each component, and we tested iteration counts of 100, 500, and 1000

:::

## Aim 3: Three migration systems

**Temporal trends**

![](images/aim3_temporal.png)

::: notes
2013: ACA roll out; TX, MS, AL, GA, FL, SC, TN, WY, WI, KS did not expand medicaid but 37 other states did

diff in diff study using ACS migration data found that the ACA was not assoc w significant migration [@goodman2017]

2018: tax cuts and jobs act TCJA

diff in diff thesis found sig negative impacts on migration to high tax states [@simonson2022] this study also used ACS data

PURELY SPECULATIVE ; cannot form any conclusions based on this

ALSO LIKELY DUE TO ESTABLISHED IRS DATA ISSUE: including steep decline 2011-2014 then sharp increases until 2016, volatility after [@dewaard2022]
:::

## Aim 3: Results

**Connection to county-level health**

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{r=1}^{3} \beta_{o_r} o_{ir} + \sum_{r=1}^{3} \beta_{d_r} d_{jr} + \sum_{r=1}^{3} \beta_{t_r} t_{kr} + \sum_{n=2}^{6} \gamma_n \text{Urbanicity}_n + \mu_{it} $$

::: incremental
-   Increased origin loadings in ***Component 2: Specific phenomena*** $(o_{i2})$ are associated with higher premature mortality rates

-   Increased destination loadings in ***Component 1: Urban-to-rural*** $(d_{i1})$ and ***Component 3: State borders*** $(d_{i3})$ are associated with lower premature mortality rates

-   Even after accounting for a county's position within a migration system, the effect of urbanicity remains significant

    -   Urbanicity gradient: effect of urbanicity increases as counties become more rural (i.e. as $n$ increases)
:::

## Aim 3: Pitfalls and Alternatives

::: incremental
-   Ambiguous - somewhat dependent upon individual perception

-   Non-convex

    -   Ensemble decomposition and/or consensus clustering

-   IRS data

    -   Highly sparse

    -   Temporality issues

    -   Non-representative

-   NARROWED GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE
:::

::: notes
Tensor decomposition is a nonconvex problem meaning that there are many possible solutions - the best way I've heard this described is like a forest

Its still very new!!! almquist paper finally peer reviewed less than 2 weeks ago!

Other methods:

PCA ; not as structured; harder to interpret ; often 2d

ensemble decomposition: aggregates results from multiple runs to provide a more stable solution ; then uses correlation or "permutation alignment" to id components that appear consistently across decomps

consensus clustering: consensus matrix is a square matrix where each entry represents the freq or proportion of times two data points are clustered together (ie part of the decomp??) across all runs ; ie if 2pts are in the same decomp 80% of the runs, the consensus matrix entry for those pts is 0.8

ONLY IF ASKED: gini coeff as originally proposed in 2022 would allow us to compare across components ; but ranking allows us to ID counties that are the largest migration contributors but no insight into balance or spread of contributors
:::

## Conclusions

::: incremental
-   **Aim 1:**

    -   Contextual factors persist even after we adjust for compositional factors.

    -   Contextual factors matter more in urban counties than in rural counties.

-   **Aim 2:**

    -   There is some evidence of health-related selection occurring for migration from urban origins to urban destinations.

    -   No evidence of health-related selection occurring for migration to rural destinations.

-   **Aim 3:**

    -   The effect of urbanicity persists even after we adjust for a county's position within a migration system.

    -   Tensor decomposition is an exciting new method for distilling the complexities of migration.
:::

## Future Questions

::: incremental
-   Can we replicate the findings of Aims 2 and 3 using the ACS five year data?

-   Need for smaller unit of analysis (census tract? mobile device?) and more inclusive data OR state and regions specific analyses

-   What will happen to places that experience forced or voluntary exodus of unauthorized immigrants?

-   Increased need for place-based assessments of health to quantify potential impacts of the next administration
:::

::: notes
Unauthorized immigrants represented 3.3% of the total US population as of 2022 [@krogstad2024]

we could see increases in differences across states in terms of health policy - we will need to have clear understandings of who and what is being measured in order to advocate for evidence based policy

## Aim 2: Data

All analyses are from the perspective of a destination county of migration. Counties are included in our analyses if they:

::: incremental
-   Are a migration destination

-   Are part of the contiguous US

-   Included a total of 3107 US counties in our analyses.

-   Used years 2011 to 2019 (9 years total)
:::

## Aim 2: Variables - derivation of $d_{ij}$

**Exploratory explanatory factor:** adjusted migration term, denoted $amig_{it}$ for county $i$ in year $t$ with new parameters $k_{ij}$ and $l_i$ for each origin-destination pair.

$$  amig_{it}(k_{ij}, l_i) = \frac{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} ( y_{j,t-1} + k_{ij}) + (y_{i,t-1} + l_i) (pop_{i, t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})}{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} + (pop_{i,t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})} $$

## Aim 2: Variables

**Exploratory explanatory factor:** adjusted migration term, denoted $amig_{it}$ for county $i$ in year $t$

Let $d_{ij} = k_{ij} - l_i$. Then:

$$  amig_{it} = \frac{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} ( y_{j,t-1} + l_i + d_{ij}) + (y_{i,t-1} +l_i)( pop_{i, t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})}{ \sum_{j\ne i} out_{jit} + (pop_{i,t-1} - \sum_{j\ne i} out_{ijt})} $$
